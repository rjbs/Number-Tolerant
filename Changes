Revision history for Number::Tolerant

1.702   TBA
        overload smart matching, as used by when [Smylers]

1.701   2010-11-29

        include Test::Tolerant

1.700   2010-08-10
        major changes to support rational numbers via BigRat; n +/- a/b

        refuse to build impossible intersections as previously promised
          (now fatal, as all previous undef-on-failures became in 1.600)

        several "0 treated like undef" bugs fixed

1.601   2008-10-06
        remove tests that non-author testers should not run

1.600   2008-07-30
        Still tolerant after all these years!
        100% test coverage restored

        THIS MAY BREAK YOUR CODE:
        "return undef on error" has been replaced by "throw exception on error"
        ...when creating a tolerance with bogus args
        ...and intersecting a tolerance with a constant outside its range

1.556   2006-06-11
        perl critic, and other minor format/packaging changes

1.555   2006-06-11
        use Sub::Exporter to export

1.540   2006-05-18

        added end-point exclusion
        rewrote exensibilty as subclassing, like a sane person would
