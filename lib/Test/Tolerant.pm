# ABSTRACT: test routines for testing numbers against tolerances

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Test::More;
  use Test::Tolerant;

  my $total = rand(6) + rand(6) + rand(6);
  is_tol(10, [ qw( 3 to 18 ) ], "got an acceptable result from random dice");

  done_testing;

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 is_tol

  is_tol($have, $want_spec, $comment);

C<is_tol> is the only routine provided by Test::Tolerant, and is exported by
default.  It beahves like C<L<is|Test::More/is>> from Test::More, asserting
that two values must be equal, but it will always use numeric equality, and the
second argument is not always used as the right hand side of comparison
directly, but it used to produce a L<Number::Tolerant> to compare to.

C<$have_spec> can be:

  * a Number::Tolerant object
  * an arrayref of args to Number::Tolerant->new
  * a string to be passed to Number::Tolerant->from_string
    * a literal number falls under this group

If the value is outside of spec, you'll get a diagnostic message something like
this:

  given value is outside acceptable tolerances
      have: 3
      want: 5 < x
